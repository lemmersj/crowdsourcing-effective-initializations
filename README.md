# Crowdsourcing More Effective Initializations for Single-target Trackers through Automatic Re-querying
This repository contains the code used for the paper "Crowdsourcing More Effective Initializations for Single-target Trackers through Automatic Re-querying," published at the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) 2021. If you find this work helpful, please cite:
[TODO: add citation and link.]

This work is separated into two folders: /mturk_tools/ contains files related to the crowdsourcing of initialization bounding boxes, and is derived from the annotation tool [here](https://github.com/kyamagu/bbox-annotator).  /tracker/ contains the files related to the analysis of tracker performance using the crowdsourced initializations. Its code is derived from [DaSiamRPN](https://github.com/foolwood/DaSiamRPN).
